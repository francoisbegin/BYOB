Build Your Own Botnet

This repository contains most of the files that relate to my SANS Paper title BYOB: Build Your Own Botnet, which I wrote back in 2011 as a gold paper for my GSEC certification.

The code and files will not run as-is: setting up the environment to support key logging was complicated enough :-), but I am making the code available as a companion to my paper - and since I do get requests once in a while for the actual code.

This is *not* a sophisticated botnet, but rather just a proof-of-concept to illustrate how a botnet functions
