Build Your Own Botnet

This repository contains most of the files that relate to my SANS Paper title BYOB: Build Your Own Botnet, which I wrote back in 2011 as a gold paper for my GSEC certification. The paper can be found here: https://www.sans.org/reading-room/whitepapers/threats/byob-build-botnet-33729

The code and files will not run as-is: setting up the environment to support key logging was complicated enough! If you want to play with this code, you will need to re-write certain sections. The code also made use of a back-end database server, which I do not think is documented. Still, I am making the code available as a companion to my paper, and I do get requests once in a while for this code.

Note that this is *not* a sophisticated botnet, but rather proof-of-concept code to illustrate how a botnet functions
